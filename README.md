# red-rez

**red-rez (*red*istributable *rez*) is a script used to create a working rez system on a Windows machine regardless of any previously installed Python version.
The created folder can be copy-pasted on other machines too and, with a few hacks, work without issues or complex setup processes.**

## Introduction

At our studio we use different DCCs, but mostly Blender and Unreal Engine, both 4 and 5 version.
Custom tools can speed up the development and improve our pipeline, but each software uses it's own Python version: managing packages and modules by hand is a pain.
So one day, suggested by some community members, I decided to solve this problem with *rez*.
When I tried to setup rez for the first time on the office Windows machine I encountered some issues, mostly due to some messy Python installation already present on the PC.
I wanted to install the tool on other machines but every person had his personal setup and manage every specific case by hand was quite tedious.

My goal was to have a quick script capable to do the job for me: install and configure rez without problems and find a way to quickly replicate the setup on other machines.
How to do that?

## Solution

### WinPython installed rez
rez needs python to run. But I can't control Python versions on users' PCs.
At first I used the official embeddable Python interpreter but I had some issues: it's not *really* portable after all.
So I decided to give [WinPython](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/) a chance and bind my rez to it.
Since I need Python just for have rez working and resolve environments it's fine to use WinPython: once the env is resolved I can use other interpreters from we DCCs we use.

## Usage
redrez is a command line script: basic usage is:
`redrez [-h] {install,pack,deploy} ... local_folder`
where local_folder is the rez directory on user's machine.

At the moment only the *install* subcommand is working and tested.

`usage: redrez install [-h] [-m UNIT] [-r RELEASE_FOLDER] [-p]`

`optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m UNIT, --map UNIT   Map the local folder to another disk unit during the
                        install process
  -r RELEASE_FOLDER, --release RELEASE_FOLDER
                        Set a remote folder as release_packages_path
  -p, --path            Add rez to user Path environment variable`


### Setup breakdown
The rez setup performed by red-rez can be summarized as follows: 
- User must provide a *local install folder*, an unused (and agreed at studio level) *unit letter* and an agreed *remote folder*
- The local folder is created if not present and mapped to the unit letter provided using *subst* command: from now on the script always use the new unit for paths, instead of local folder
- A registry key is added to execute the *subst* command at every Windows startup
- WinPython is unzipped in the local folder
- rez is unzipped in a temp folder
- WinPython is used to setup rez
- rez bin path is added to user's Path env var
- A rezconfig.py file is written, with all needed packages paths inside (the local remapped one and the remote one)
- The REZ_CONFIG_FILE env var pointing to the rezconfig file is created
- WinPython interpreter is packaged for future Python usage
- Bind arc, os,platform and create *locally stored* packages
- Create a *launchers* folder and a testing .bat file that just resolve an environment with Python
- Delete all temp folders and files

### Redistribution
At this point it's possible to copy paste the folder containing all (rez,python,packages,launchers) to another machine. If the unit letter is mapped and the REZ_CONFIG_FILE env var points to the correct file, rez will be immediately working on that machine.
